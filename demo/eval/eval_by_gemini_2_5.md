# Simulated Evaluation of Trump Tariff Policy Reports

This evaluation assesses reports on the "Impact of Trump Tariff Policies on the Global Economy" found in the `demo/us_tariff` and `demo/us_tariff_augmented` directories. The assessment uses the criteria and weighting defined in `demo/eval/eval_guide.md`.

**Disclaimer:** This is a *simulated* evaluation based on assumptions about the reports' likely quality derived from filenames (model source, augmented status). Actual content was not read. Scores are relative estimates.
